# Week 2: Blockchain Architecture and Components  

## 1. Introduction  
Blockchain architecture defines the structure, components, and mechanisms that make blockchain secure, decentralized, and efficient.  
This session covers the core elements of blockchain networks, including blocks, nodes, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts.

## 2. Blockchain Structure  
Blockchain consists of **blocks** linked together to form a chain. Each block contains:  
- **Block Header**: Includes metadata such as timestamp, block number, and cryptographic hash of the previous block.  
- **Transaction List**: Stores verified transactions added to the blockchain.  
- **Nonce and Hash**: Used in mining to secure the block and maintain integrity.

## 3. Nodes and Network  
Nodes are the computers that participate in the blockchain network, helping maintain and secure the system. Common types of nodes include:  

- **Full Nodes**: Store the entire blockchain and validate transactions.  
- **Light Nodes**: Store only essential data and rely on full nodes for verification.  
- **Mining Nodes**: Solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks (used in Proof of Work).  

Blockchain networks can be categorized into:  
- **Public Blockchains**: Open networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.  
- **Private Blockchains**: Restricted-access networks used by enterprises.  
- **Consortium Blockchains**: Semi-private networks managed by multiple organizations.

## 4. Consensus Mechanisms  
Consensus mechanisms are protocols that ensure all nodes agree on the current state of the blockchain. Common types include:  

- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles to add blocks (e.g., Bitcoin).  
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold (e.g., Ethereum 2.0).  
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: Token holders vote for delegates to validate transactions (e.g., EOS).  
- **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)**: Used in permissioned blockchains for fast and secure consensus (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric).

## 5. Smart Contracts  
Smart contracts are **self-executing contracts** with predefined rules written in code. They enable trustless transactions and automation.  

- **How Smart Contracts Work**:  
  - Code is deployed on the blockchain.  
  - The contract executes automatically when conditions are met.  
  - Transactions are irreversible and publicly recorded.  

- **Use Cases**:  
  - **Finance**: Automated payments, decentralized exchanges.  
  - **Supply Chain**: Tracking goods and verifying authenticity.  
  - **Legal**: Smart contract-based agreements without intermediaries.

## 6. Blockchain Layers  
Blockchain networks are built using different layers for scalability and efficiency:  

- **Layer 1 (Main Blockchain)**:  
  - The base layer where transactions are recorded (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).  
  - Supports security and decentralization but can face scalability issues.  

- **Layer 2 (Scaling Solutions)**:  
  - Built on top of Layer 1 to improve transaction speed and reduce fees.  
  - Examples: **Lightning Network (Bitcoin), Optimistic Rollups (Ethereum)**.  

- **Off-Chain Solutions**:  
  - Transactions occur outside the main blockchain but are later recorded on-chain.  
  - Used for reducing network congestion and increasing efficiency.

## 7. Summary  
Blockchain architecture consists of multiple components that ensure decentralization, security, and efficiency.  
- Blocks store transactions securely.  
- Nodes maintain and validate the blockchain network.  
- Consensus mechanisms prevent fraud and ensure agreement.  
- Smart contracts automate processes and enable decentralized applications.  
- Layered architectures improve blockchain scalability.  

Understanding these fundamentals will help us explore **decentralized applications (DApps) and tokenization** in the next session.
